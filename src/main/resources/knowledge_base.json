    "question": "I need to replace my laptop battery",
    "answer": "For company-owned devices, battery replacement should be handled through your organization's IT hardware support process. Submit a ticket describing battery performance issues - include specific symptoms like short runtime or unexpected shutdowns. IT may run diagnostics to confirm battery health before approving replacement. Some organizations have warranty or service contracts that cover battery replacement. For user-replaceable batteries, ensure you order the exact model specified for your laptop. For built-in batteries (most modern laptops), professional installation is recommended. Keep your data backed up before any hardware service.",

    "question": "How do I set up out-of-office replies in email?",
    "answer": "In Outlook desktop, go to File > Automatic Replies (Out of Office). Select 'Send automatic replies' and set a date range if desired. Create separate messages for inside and outside your organization. In Outlook Web Access (OWA), click Settings (gear icon) > View all Outlook settings > Mail > Automatic replies. For Gmail, go to Settings > See all settings > General > Vacation responder. Include your return date and alternative contact information in your message. Consider setting up email delegation for critical matters during extended absences. Disable automatic replies when you return if they don't auto-disable.",
